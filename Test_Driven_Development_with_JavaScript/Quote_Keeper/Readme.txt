Quote Keeper

In this project we wrote a feature test for the development of a web application that allows users to save and display a collection of their favorite quotes.

Quote Keeper should allow users to enter the following information about each quote they would like to save to the app:

The quote itself
Who the quote is attributed to
The source of the quote:
Book
Article
Speech
IRL

This project focuses on feature tests at the top level of the TDD Testing Pyramid, it will only cover the feature tests process up to the point of getting an error about the exercise phase of test suite.
In order to progress we would need to drop down to the server layer of the Testing Pyramid, which is not covered here.
The completed form of this project will have a feature test suite that is ready to move on to tests at the server level.
